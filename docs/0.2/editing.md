# Using Froggum

## Editing

In the editor view, double-clicking on a path will select it. You can also
select a path by double-clicking on its row in the sidebar.

When a path is selected, it will be outlined in red, with a blue frame on some
segments, and red control handles will appear around any draggable point. All
control handles can be dragged around as you wish, and everything is
automatically saved.

Double-clicking off of a path will deselect it, and hide all controls.

Control-Z and Control-Y work as undo and redo, respectively.
